[abstract]
== Abstract

LEAF is a {CPP}11 error handling library. Features:

====
* Header-only, no dependencies.

* No dynamic memory allocations.footnote:[Except when error objects are transported between threads, see <<capture-expect,`capture`>>.]

* Associate objects of arbitrary types with any failure -- when it is initially reported or at a later time.

* Compatible with `std::error_code`, `errno` and any other error handling API.

* Use with or without exception handling.

* Support for multi-thread programming.

NOTE: If you're at least an intermediate level developer and have seen `expected`/`outcome`-like interfaces before, and you are also wondering how the heck you can return a type-erased error object without using heap allocations, you may want to read the <<rationale>> first.

[[introduction]]
== Two Minute Introduction

Let's assume that to handle a particular failure, we need an error code, a file name, and, optionally, a request ID. In terms of LEAF, we can write:

====
[source,c++]
----
{
  leaf::expect<e_error_code, e_file_name, e_request_id> exp; //<1>

  if( leaf::result<T> r = f() )
  {
    //Success! //<2>
  }
  else
  {
    bool matched = leaf::handle_error( exp, r, //<3>

      leaf::match<e_error_code, e_file_name, e_request_id>( [ ]( int ec, std::string const & fn, uuid const & id )
      {
        //<4>
      } ),

      leaf::match<e_error_code, e_file_name>( [ ]( int ec, std::string const & fn )
      {
        //<5>
      } )

    );
  }
}
----
<1> The `exp` object provides storage for an `e_error_code`, an `e_file_name` and an `e_request_id`, which `f()` (next line) may communicate in case it fails.
<2> Successful result values are stored inside of `r` of type `result<T>`, which is a value-or-error variant type.
<3> The call to `f()` has failed, so we pass `exp` and the returned `r` to `handle_error`, followed by several (in this case, two) *sets of error object types* to be matched (`handle_error` returns false if it doesn't find a match).
<4> Handle the case where we received `e_error_code`, `e_file_name` and `e_request_id`, associated with the failure reported in `r`.
<5> Handle the case where we only received `e_error_code` and `e_file_name`, associated with the failure reported in `r`.

[.text-right]
`<<expect,expect>>` | `<<result,result>>` | <<handle_error-result>> | <<match>>
====

`e_error_code`, `e_file_name` and `e_request_id` are user-defined, e.g.:

====
[source,c++]
----
struct e_error_code { int value; };

struct e_file_name { std::string value; };

struct e_request_id { uuid value; };
----
====

Reporting an error with LEAF looks like this:

====
[source,c++]
----
leaf::result<T> g() noexcept
{
  if( success )
    return T(....); <1>
  else
    return leaf::error( e_error_code{42}, e_request_id{id} ); //<2>
}
----
<1> Initializing the returned `result<T>` with a `T` object indicates a success.
<2> Report an error, store the passed `e_error_code` and `e_request_id` in appropriate `expect` object(s) from calling scopes. Presumably, at this point we don't have access to a relevant file name, but that's fine -- we associate with the reported error what relevant information we do have: the error code and the request ID.

[.text-right]
`<<result,result>>` | `<<error::error,error::error>>`
====

Forwarding an error reported by a lower level function looks like this:

====
[source,c++]
----
leaf::result<T> f() noexcept
{
  if( leaf::result<T> r=g() )
  {
    ....
    return r; //<1>
  }
  else
    return r.error( e_file_name{"file.txt"} ); //<2>
}
----
<1> Success, return `r`.
<2> Forward the error reported in `r`, storing `e_file_name` in appropriate `expect` object(s) from calling scopes. The file name will be associated with the error in addition to the relevant `e_error_code` and `e_request_id` which (presumably) `g()` has already communicated.

== What If I Want to Use Exception Handling?

That would be a 1-minute introduction. :-)

Let's again assume that to handle a particular exception, we need an error code, a file name, and, optionally, a request ID. In terms of LEAF, we can write:

====
[source,c++]
----
{
  leaf::expect<e_error_code, e_file_name, e_request_id> exp; //<1>

  try
  {
    f();
  }
  catch( my_exception const & e )
  {
    leaf::handle_exception( exp, e, //<2>

      leaf::match<e_error_code, e_file_name, e_request_id>( [ ]( int ec, std::string const & fn, uuid const & id )
      {
        //<3>
      } ),

      leaf::match<e_error_code, e_file_name>( [ ]( int ec, std::string const & fn )
      {
        //<4>
      } )

    );
  }
}
----
<1> The `exp` object provides storage for an `e_error_code`, an `e_file_name` and an `e_request_id`, which `f()` (next line) may communicate in case it throws.
<2> We caught a `my_exception` from `f()`, so we pass `exp` and the the exception object `e` to `handle_exception`, followed by several (in this case, two) *sets of error object types* to be matched (`handle_exception` rethrows the original exception if it doesn`t find a match).
<3> Handle the case where we received `e_error_code`, `e_file_name` and `e_request_id`, associated with `e`.
<4> Handle the case where we only received `e_error_code` and `e_file_name`, associated with `e`.

[.text-right]
`<<expect,expect>>` | <<handle_exception>> | <<match>>
====

Error objects can be passed to LEAF at the point of the `throw`:

====
[source,c++]
----
T g()
{
  if( success )
    return T(....); <1>
  else
    throw leaf::exception<my_exception>( e_error_code{42}, e_request_id{id} ); //<2>
}
----
<1> Success, just return `T`.
<2> Throw a `my_exception` object, store the passed `e_error_code` and `e_request_id` in appropriate `expect` object(s) from calling scopes. Presumably, at this point we don't have access to a relevant file name, but that's fine -- we associate with exception object what relevant information we do have: the error code and the request ID.

[.text-right]
<<exception>>
====

Exceptions can be augmented in exception-neutral contexts:

====
[source,c++]
----
void f()
{
  auto propagate = leaf::preload( e_file_name{"file.txt"} ); //<1>

  g();
}
----
<1> In case `g()` throws, the file name will be associated with the exception object, in addition to the relevant `e_error_code` and `e_request_id` which (presumably) `g()` has already communicated.

[[tutorial]]
== Tutorial

We'll write a short but complete program, using LEAF to handle errors. We'll implement two versions, one that uses exception handling, and one that does not. To see the source code of the complete programs from this tutorial, follow these links:

* https://github.com/zajo/leaf/blob/master/example/print_file_result.cpp?ts=3[print_file_result.cpp] (without exception handling)
* https://github.com/zajo/leaf/blob/master/example/print_file_eh.cpp?ts=3[print_file_eh.cpp] (with exception handling)

First, let's see how to use LEAF without exception handling.

[[tutorial-noexcept]]
=== Using `result<T>`

We'll write a program that reads a text file in a buffer and prints it to `std::cout`, using LEAF to handle errors. First, we need an `enum` to define our different error codes, and a simple type `e_error_code` to help LEAF tell error codes apart from other `int` values:

====
[source,c++]
----
enum
{
  input_file_open_error,
  input_file_size_error,
  input_file_read_error,
  input_eof_error,
  cout_error
};

struct e_error_code { int value; };
----
====

We don't need an enumerated value that indicates success. That's because we will use the convenient class template `<<result,result>><T>` as the return type in functions which may fail. It is a value-or-error variant type which holds a `T` except if initialized with a `leaf::<<error,error>>`.

Here is a function that reads data from a `FILE` into a buffer and reports the various errors which may occur (it returns `result<void>` because in case of success it doesn't return a value):

====
[source,c++]
----
leaf::result<void> file_read( FILE & f, void * buf, int size )
{
  int n = fread(buf,1,size,&f);
  if( ferror(&f) )
    return leaf::error( e_error_code{input_file_read_error}, e_errno{errno} ); //<1>

  if( n!=size )
    return leaf::error( e_error_code{input_eof_error} ); //<2>

  return { }; //<3>
}
----
<1> If `ferror` indicates an error, we return `input_file_read_error` and, because there is a relevant `errno` code, we _also_ pass that to the `leaf::<<error,error>>` constructor (LEAF defines `struct e_errno { int value; }`).
<2> If `fread` reports that it couldn't read all of the data requested, we return `input_eof_error`. In this case there is no relevant `errno` to pass on, because this is not an error as far as `fread` is concerned.
<3> `result<void>` can be initialized with `{ }` to indicate success.

[.text-right]
`<<result,result>>` | `<<error::error,error::error>>`
====

NOTE: The `e_error_code` and `e_errno` structs are examples of types that may be passed to the `leaf::error` constructor. The requirement for such types is that they define an accessible data member `value` and `noexcept` move constructor. These types allow us to assign different error-related semantics to different values of otherwise identical static types. +
 +
For example, we could define `struct e_input_name { std::string value; }` and `struct e_output_name { std::string value; }` and LEAF will treat them as separate entities even though their `.value` members are of the same type `std::string`. +
 +
In this text we refer to such types as <<e-types,e-types>>, because by convention they use the `e_` prefix.

Now, let's consider a possible caller of `file_read`, called `print_file`:

====
[source,c++]
----
leaf::result<void> print_file( char const * file_name )
{
  leaf::result<std::shared_ptr<FILE>> f = file_open(file_name);
  if( !f ) //<1>
    return f.error(); //<2>

  auto propagate = leaf::preload( e_file_name{file_name} ); //<3>

  leaf::result<int> s = file_size(*f.value());
  if( !s ) //<4>
    return s.error(); //<5>

  std::string buffer( 1+s.value(), '\0' );
  leaf::result<void> fr = file_read(*f.value,&buffer[0],buffer.size()-1);
  if( !fr )
    return fr.error();

  std::cout << buffer;
  std::cout.flush();
  if( std::cout.fail() )
    return leaf::error( e_error_code{cout_error} ); //<6>

  return { }; //<7>
}
----
<1> If `file_open` returns an error...
<2> ...we forward it to the caller. Notice that we don't return `leaf::error()`, which would indicate a newly detected error; we return `f.error()`, which propagates the error already stored in `f`.
<3> `<<preload,preload>>` takes any number of <<e-types>> and prepares them to become associated (automatically, at the time the returned object expires) with the first `leaf::<<error,error>>` value created thereafter. The effect is that from this point on, any error returned or forwarded by `print_file` will have an associated file name, in addition to everything else passed to `leaf::<<error,error>>` explicitly (`e_file_name` is defined as `struct e_file_name { std::string value; }`).
<4> If `file_size` returns an error...
<5> ...we forward it to the caller.
<6> If `std::cout` fails to write the buffer, we return `cout_error`.
<7> Success!

[.text-right]
`<<result,result>>` | `<<result::error,result::error>>` | <<preload>>
====

Notice the repetitiveness in simply forwarding errors to the caller. LEAF defines two macros, `<<LEAF_AUTO,LEAF_AUTO>>` and `<<LEAF_CHECK,LEAF_CHECK>>`, which can help reduce the clutter:

* The `LEAF_AUTO` macro takes two arguments, an identifier and a `result<T>`. In case the passed `result<T>` indicates an error, `LEAF_AUTO` returns that error to the caller (therefore control leaves the enclosing function). In case of success, `LEAF_AUTO` defines a variable, of type `T &` (using the provided identifier) that refers to the `T` object stored inside the passed `result<T>`.

* The `LEAF_CHECK` macro is designed to be used similarly in functions that return `result<void>`, but of course it doesn't define a variable.

Below is the same `print_file` function simplified using `LEAF_AUTO` and `LEAF_CHECK` (remember that the variables defined by `LEAF_AUTO` are not of type `result<T>`, but of type `T &`; for example `s` used to be `result<int>`, but now it is simply `int &`):

====
[source,c++]
----
leaf::result<void> print_file( char const * file_name )
{
  LEAF_AUTO(f,file_open(file_name)); //<1>

  auto propagate = leaf::preload( e_file_name{file_name} );

  LEAF_AUTO(s,file_size(*f)); //<2>

  std::string buffer( 1+s, '\0' );
  LEAF_CHECK(file_read(*f,&buffer[0],buffer.size()-1)); //<3>

  std::cout << buffer;
  std::cout.flush();
  if( std::cout.fail() )
    return leaf::error( e_error_code{cout_error} );

  return { };
}
----
<1> Call `file_open`, check for errors, unpack the returned `result<std::shared_ptr<FILE>>` and define a variable `f` of type `std::shared_ptr<FILE> &` that refers to its `<<result::value,value>>()`.
<2> Call `file_size`, check for errors, unpack the returned `result<int>` and define a variable `s` of type `int &` that refers to its `value()`.
<3> Call `file_read`, check for errors (`file_read` returns `result<void>`).

[.text-right]
<<LEAF_AUTO>> | <<LEAF_CHECK>> | <<preload>> | `<<error::error,error::error>>`
====

Finally, let's look at the `main` function, which handles all errors in this program:

====
[source,c++]
----
int main( int argc, char const * argv[ ] )
{
  char const * fn = parse_command_line(argc,argv);
  if( !fn )
  {
    std::cout << "Bad command line argument" << std::endl;
    return 1;
  }

  //We expect e_error_code, e_file_name and e_errno objects to be associated
  //with errors handled in this function. They will be stored inside of exp.
  leaf::expect<e_error_code, e_file_name, e_errno> exp;

  if( auto r = print_file(fn) )
  {
    return 0; //Success, we're done!
  }
  else
  {
    //Probe exp for the e_error_code object associated with the error stored in r.
    switch( auto ec = *leaf::peek<e_error_code>(exp,r) )
    {
      case input_file_open_error:
      {
        //handle_error takes a list of match objects (in this case only one), each given
        //a set of e-types. It attempts to match each set (in order) to objects of e-types
        //available in exp, which are associated with the error value stored in r. If no
        //set can be matched, handle_error returns false. When a match is found,
        //handle_error calls the corresponding lambda function, passing the .value of
        //each of the e-types from the matched set.
        bool matched = handle_error( exp, r,

          leaf::match<e_file_name,e_errno>( [ ] ( std::string const & fn, int errn )
          {
            if( errn==ENOENT )
              std::cerr << "File not found: " << fn << std::endl;
            else
              std::cerr << "Failed to open " << fn << ", errno=" << errn << std::endl;
          } )

        );
        assert(matched);
        return 2;
      }

      case input_file_size_error:
      case input_file_read_error:
      case input_eof_error:
      {
        //In this case handle_error is given 3 match sets. It will first check if both
        //e_file_name and e_errno, associated with r, are available in exp; if not, it will
        //next check if just e_errno is available; and if not, the last (empty) set will
        //always match to print a generic error message.
        bool matched = handle_error( exp, r,

          leaf::match<e_file_name,e_errno>( [ ] ( std::string const & fn, int errn )
          {
            std::cerr << "Failed to access " << fn << ", errno=" << errn << std::endl;
          } ),

          leaf::match<e_errno>( [ ] ( int errn )
          {
            std::cerr << "I/O error, errno=" << errn << std::endl;
          } ),

          leaf::match<>( [ ]
          {
            std::cerr << "I/O error" << std::endl;
          } )

        );
        assert(matched);
        return 3;
      }

      case cout_error:
      {
        //Report failure to write to std::cout, print the relevant errno.
        bool matched = handle_error( exp, r,

          leaf::match<e_errno>( [ ] ( int errn )
          {

        return 4;
      }

      //This catch-all case helps diagnose logic errors (presumably, missing case labels
      //in the switch statement).
      default:

    }
  }
}

====

To summarize, when using LEAF without exception handling:

* Functions that may fail return instances of `<<result,result>><T>`, a value-or-error variant class template.
* In case a function detects a failure, the returned `result<T>` can be initialized implicitly by returning `leaf::<<error,error>>`, which may be passed any and all information we have that is relevant to the failure, in the form of <<e-types>>.
* When a lower level function reports an error, that error is forwarded to the caller, passing any additional relevant information available in the current scope.
* In order for any <<e-types,e-type>> object passed to `leaf::<<error,error>>` to be stored rather than discarded, the function that handles the error must contain an instance of the class template `<<expect,expect>>` that provides the necessary storage for that type.
* Using `<<handle_error-expect,handle_error>>`, available <<e-types,e-type>> objects associated with the `<<error,error>>` value being handled can be matched to what is required in order to deal with that `error`.

NOTE: The complete program from this tutorial is available https://github.com/zajo/leaf/blob/master/example/print_file_result.cpp?ts=3[here]. There is also https://github.com/zajo/leaf/blob/master/example/print_file_eh.cpp?ts=3[another] version of the same program that uses exception handling to report errors (see <<tutorial-eh,tutorial below>>).

[[tutorial-eh]]
=== Using Exception Handling

And now, we'll write the same program that reads a text file in a buffer and prints it to `std::cout`, this time using exceptions to report errors. First, we need to define our exception class hierarchy:

====
[source,c++]
----
struct print_file_error : virtual std::exception { };
struct command_line_error : virtual print_file_error { };
struct bad_command_line : virtual command_line_error { };
struct input_error : virtual print_file_error { };
struct input_file_error : virtual input_error { };
struct input_file_open_error : virtual input_file_error { };
struct input_file_size_error : virtual input_file_error { };
struct input_file_read_error : virtual input_file_error { };
struct input_eof_error : virtual input_file_error { };
----
====

TIP: To avoid ambiguities in the implicit type conversion done when catching a base type, it is generally recommended to use virtual inheritance in exception type hierarchies.

Here is a function that reads data from a file into a buffer and throws exceptions to communicate failures:

====
[source,c++]
----
void file_read( FILE & f, void * buf, int size )
{
  int n = fread(buf,1,size,&f);

  if( ferror(&f) )
    throw leaf::exception<input_file_read_error>( e_errno{errno} ); //<1>

  if( n!=size )
    throw input_eof_error(); //<2>
}
----
<1> If `ferror` indicates an error, we throw `input_file_read_error` and, because there is a relevant `errno` code, we pass that to the `<<exception::exception,exception>>` constructor _also_ (LEAF defines `struct e_errno { int value; }`).
<2> If `fread` reports that it couldn't read all of the data requested, we throw `input_eof_error`. In this case there is no relevant `errno` to pass on, because this is not an error as far as `fread` is concerned.

[.text-right]
<<exception>>
====

NOTE: The `e_error_code` and `e_errno` structs are examples of types that may be passed to the `leaf::<<exception::exception,exception>>` (and to the `leaf::<<error,error>>`) constructor. The requirement for such types is that they define an accessible data member `value` and `noexcept` move constructor. These types allow us to assign different error-related semantics to different values of otherwise identical static types. +
 +
For example, we could define `struct e_input_name { std::string value; }` and `struct e_output_name { std::string value; }` and LEAF will treat them as separate entities even though their `.value` members are of the same type `std::string`. +
 +
In this text we refer to such types as <<e-types,e-types>>, because by convention they use the `e_` prefix.

Now, let's consider a possible caller of `file_read`, called `print_file`:

====
[source,c++]
----
void print_file( char const * file_name )
{
  std::shared_ptr<FILE> f = file_open( file_name ); //<1>

  auto propagate1 = leaf::preload( e_file_name{file_name} ); //<2>

  std::string buffer( 1+file_size(*f), '\0' ); //<3>
  file_read(*f,&buffer[0],buffer.size()-1);

  auto propagate2 = leaf::defer( [ ] { return e_errno{errno}; } ); //<4>
  std::cout << buffer;
  std::cout.flush();
}
----
<1> `std::shared_ptr<FILE> file_open( char const * file_name)` throws on error.
<2> `<<preload,preload>>` takes any number of <<e-types,e-type>> objects and prepares them to become associated (automatically, at the time the returned object expires) with the first exception thrown thereafter. The effect is that from this point on, a file name will be associated with any exception escaping `print_file`, in addition to everything else passed earlier to the `leaf::<<exception::exception,exception>>` constructor explicitly (`e_file_name` is defined as `struct e_file_name { std::string value; }`).
<3> `int file_size( FILE & f )` throws on error.
<4> `<<defer,defer>>` is similar to `preload`: it prepares an e-type object to become associated with the first exception thrown thereafter, but instead of taking the e-type object itself, `defer` takes a function that returns it. The function is invoked in the returned object's destructor, at which point it becomes associated with the exception being propagated. Assuming `std::cout` is configured to throw on error, the effect of this line is that those exceptions will have the relevant `errno` associated with them.

[.text-right]
<<preload>> | <<defer>>
====

Finally, let's consider the `main` function, which is able to handle exceptions thrown by `print_file`:

====
[source,c++]
----
int main( int argc, char const * argv[ ] )
{
  //Configure std::cout to throw on error.
   std::cout.exceptions ( std::ostream::failbit | std::ostream::badbit );

  //We expect e_error_code, e_file_name and e_errno objects to be associated
  //with exceptions handled in this function. They will be stored inside of exp.
  leaf::expect<e_file_name, e_errno> exp;

  try
  {
    print_file(parse_command_line(argc,argv));
    return 0;
  }
  catch( bad_command_line const & )
  {
    std::cout << "Bad command line argument" << std::endl;
    return 1;
  }
  catch( input_file_open_error const & ex )
  {
    //handle_exception takes a list of match objects (in this case only one), each

To summarize, when using LEAF with exception handling:

* In case a function detects a failure, it may throw instances of the `leaf::<<exception,exception>>` class template, initializing it with (in addition to the exception object) any number of <<e-types,e-type>> objects, to associate with the exception any information it has that is relevant to the failure.
* Alternatively it may use `<<preload,preload>>` to associate <<e-types,e-type>> objects with the exception object (of any type) thrown later on, including exceptions thrown by third-party code.
* In order for any e-type object passed to the `leaf::<<exception::exception,exception>>` constructor to be stored rather than discarded, the function that catches the exception must contain an instance of the class template `<<expect,expect>>` that provides the necessary storage for its type.
* Using `<<handle_exception,handle_exception>>`, available <<e-types,e-type>> objects associated with the exception being handled can be matched to what is required in order to deal with that exception.

NOTE: The complete program from this tutorial is available https://github.com/zajo/leaf/blob/master/example/print_file_eh.cpp?ts=3[here]. There is also https://github.com/zajo/leaf/blob/master/example/print_file_result.cpp?ts=3[another] version of the same program that does not use exception handling to report errors (see <<tutorial-noexcept,previous tutorial>>).

== Reference

[[e-types]]
=== e-types

With LEAF, users can efficiently associate with errors or with exceptions any number of values that pertain to a failure. Each such value is enclosed in a C-`struct`, which acts as its compile-time identifier and gives it semantic meaning. Examples:

[source,c++]
----
struct e_input_name { std::string value; };

struct e_output_name { std::string value; };

struct e_minimum_temperature { int value; };

struct e_maximum_temperature { int value; };
----

This text refers to such types as e-types because, by convention, they use the `e_` prefix. Similarly, instances of e-types are called e-objects.

The formal requirements for e-types are:

* They must define an accessible data member `value`, and
* They must be movable, and the move constructor may not throw.

LEAF itself never creates e-objects and generally only moves the e-objects it is given. Therefore, users are free to define any constructors as needed to enforce invariants for their e-types, but the typical case is to simply enclose a `value` in a C-`struct`.

Various functions in LEAF take a list of e-objects to associate with an `<<error,error>>` value. For example, to indicate an error, a function that returns a `<<result,result>><T>` may use something like:

[source,c++]
----
return leaf::error( e_error_code{42}, e_input_name{n1}, e_output_name{n2} );
----

*Diagnostic Information*

LEAF will attempt to print e-objects in various `diagnostic_output` overloads it defines. It will first attempt to use `operator<<` overload that takes the enclosing `struct`. If such overload does not exist, the fallback is to attempt to use `operator<<` overload that takes the `.value`. If that also doesn't exist, LEAF is unable to print values of that particular e-type (this is permissible, not an error).

The `diagnostic_output` functions in LEAF can use the e-types defined in the snippet above by default, because `int` and `std::string` values are printable. But even with printable values, the user may still want to overload `operator<<` for the enclosing `struct`, e.g.:

[source,c++]
----
struct e_errno
{
  int value;

  friend std::ostream & operator<<( std::ostream & os, e_errno const & e )
  {
    return os << "errno = " << e.value << ", \"" << strerror(e.value) << '"';
  }
};
----

The `e_errno` type above is designed to hold `errno` values. The defined `operator<<` overload will automatically include the output from `strerror` when `e_errno` values are printed by `diagnostic_output` overloads (LEAF defines `e_errno` in `<boost/leaf/common.hpp>`, together with other commonly-used e-types).

TIP: The output from `diagnostic_output` overloads is developer-friendly but not user-friendly. Therefore, `operator<<` overloads for e-types should only print technical information in English, and should not attempt to localize strings or to format a message. Formatting a localized user-friendly message should be done at the time individual errors are handled.

[[expect]]
=== Class Template `expect`

[.text-right]
<<expect::expect>> | <<expect-dtor>> | <<expect::propagate>> | <<capture-expect>> | <<match>> | <<handle_error-expect>> | <<peek-expect>> | <<diagnostic_output-expect>>
====

All `expect<E...>` objects must use automatic storage duration. They are not copyable and are not movable.

The specified `E...` types must be user-defined (e.g. structs), with `noexcept` move semantics, that define accessible data member called `value`. For example:

[source,c++]
----
struct e_file_name { std::string value; };
----

In this text such types are referred to as <<e-types>>, because by convention they use the `e_` prefix. Similarly, instances of e-types are called e-objects.

An `expect<E...>` object contains exactly `sizeof...(E)` _slots_, each slot providing storage for a single object of the corresponding type `E`.  It is invalid to specify the same type more than once in `E...`; so, each type `E` uniquely identifies an `expect` slot. All slots are initially empty.

Slots of the same type `E` across different `expect` objects (that belong to the calling thread)  form a stack. The slot created last for a given type `E` is at the top of that stack. When an <<e-types,e-object>> is passed to the `leaf::<<error,error>>` constructor, it is moved into the corresponding slot on the top of that stack, and is associated with that `leaf::error` value. If no `expect` objects contain a corresponding slot, the e-object passed to the `leaf::error` constructor is discarded.

An e-object stored in an `expect` slot can be accessed in several different ways, all requiring the `leaf::error` value it was associated with. While an `expect` object can not store multiple values of the same e-type, this association guarantees that the returned e-object pertains to that specific `error` value.

Iff an error was successfully handled (a call to `<<handle_error-expect,handle_error>>` returned `true`), then `~expect` discards all e-objects stored in `*this`. Otherwise, each stored e-object is moved to the corresponding slot one level below the top of the stack formed by the slots of the same e-type across different `expect` objects. If that stack is empty, the e-object is discarded.

==== Constructor

.#include <boost/leaf/expect.hpp>

----
namespace boost { namespace leaf {

----

Description: :: Initializes an empty `expect` instance.

Postcondition: :: `<<peek-expect,peek>><P>(*this,e)` returns `0` for any `P` and any `<<error,error>>` value `e`.

'''

[[expect-dtor]]
==== Destructor

.#include <boost/leaf/expect.hpp>
[source,c++]
----
namespace boost { namespace leaf {

  expect<E...>::~expect() noexcept;

} }
----

Effects: :: By default, each stored <<e-types,e-object>> is moved to a corresponding slot in other existing `expect` instances according to the rules described `<<expect,here>>`, but if a call to `<<handle_error-expect,handle_error>>` for `*this` has succeeded, all objects currently stored in `*this` are discarded.

IMPORTANT: A call to `<<expect::propagate,propagate>>` restores the default behavior of `~expect` after a successful call to `handle_error`.

----

Effects: :: Moves all <<e-types,e-objects>> currently stored in `exp` and associated with the `leaf::<<error,error>>` value `e`, into the returned `<<error_capture,error_capture>>` object. The contents of the `error_capture` object is immutable and allocated on the heap.

----
namespace boost { namespace leaf {

} }
----

Effects: :: Each of the `m...` objects must have been obtained by a separate call to the function template `<<match,match>>`, each time instantiated with a different set of <<e-types>>, and passed a different function. +
+
The call to `handle_error` attempts to match the set of e-types from each of the `m...` objects, in order, to the types of <<e-types,e-objects>>, associated with the `<<error,error>>` value `e`, currently stored in `exp`. +
+
If a complete match is found among `m...`:
+
--
* Its function is called with the `.value` members of the entire set of matching e-objects from `exp` (the function may not modify those values);
* `exp` is marked so that `<<expect-dtor,~expect>>` will destroy all of the stored e-objects (this can be undone by a later call to `<<expect::propagate,propagate>>`);
* `handle_error` returns true.
--
+
Otherwise, `handle_error` returns false and `exp` is not modified.

Example: ::
+
[source,c++]
----
bool matched = handle_error( exp, e,

  leaf::match<e_file_name,e_errno>( [ ] ( std::string const & fn, int errn )
  {
    std::cerr << "Failed to access " << fn << ", errno=" << errn << std::endl;
  } ),

  leaf::match<e_errno>( [ ] ( int errn )
  {
    std::cerr << "I/O error, errno=" << errn << std::endl;
  } )

);
----
+
Assuming `struct e_file_name { std::string value; }` and `struct e_errno { int value; }`, the call to `handle_error` above will: +
+
* Check if the `expect` object `exp` contains `e_file_name` and `e_errno` objects, associated with the `leaf::<<error,error>>` value `e`. If it does, it will pass them to the lambda function passed in the first call to `<<match,match>>`, then return `true`;
* Otherwise if it contains just `e_errno`, it will pass it to the lambda function passed in the second call to `match`, then return `true`;
* Otherwise, `handle_error` returns `false`.

----
namespace boost { namespace leaf {

  template <class P,class... E>
  decltype(P::value) const * peek( expect<E...> const & exp, error const & e ) noexcept;

} }
----

Returns: :: If `exp` currently stores an object of type `P` associated with the `<<error,error>>` value `e`, returns a read-only pointer to that object. Otherwise returns `0`.

'''

[[diagnostic_output-expect]]
==== `diagnostic_output`

  void diagnostic_output( std::ostream & os, expect<E...> const & exp );

  template <class... E>
  void diagnostic_output( std::ostream & os, expect<E...> const & exp, error const & e );

} }
----

Effects: :: Prints diagnostic information about the <<e-types,e-type>> objects stored in `exp`. The second overload will only print diagnostic information about e-objects stored in `exp` which are associated with the `leaf::<<error,error>>` value `e`.

NOTE: The printing of each individual e-object is done by the rules described <<e-types,here>>.

====

Objects of class `error_capture` are similar to `<<expect,expect>>` instances in that they contain <<e-types,e-objects>> and can be examined by (their own overloads of) `<<peek-error_capture,peek>>` and `<<handle_error-error_capture,handle_error>>`. However, unlike `expect` objects, `error_capture` objects:

* are immutable;
* are allocated on the heap;
* associate all of their e-objects with exactly one `error` value;
* when probed with `peek`/`handle_error`, the lookup is dynamic;
* define `noexcept` copy/move/assignment operations.

The default constructor can be used to initialize an empty `error_capture`. Use `<<capture-expect,capture>>` to capture all e-objects associated with a given `error` value from a given `expect` object.

[NOTE]
--
Typical use of `error_capture` objects is to transport e-objects across threads, however they are rarely used directly. Instead:

* With exception handling, use `<<capture_exception,capture_exception>>` / `<<get,get>>`;
* Without exception handling, simply return a <<capture-result,captured>> `result<T>` from a worker thread.

==== Constructors

.#include <boost/leaf/result.hpp>
[source,c++]
----
namespace boost { namespace leaf {

  constexpr result::result() noexcept;
  constexpr result::result( T const & v );
  constexpr result::result( T && v ) noexcept;
  result::result( leaf::error const & e ) noexcept;
  result::result( leaf::error_capture const & ec ) noexcept;

} }
----

A `result<T>` object is in one of two states:

* Value state, in which case it contains an object of type `T`, and `<<result::value,value>>`/`<<result::value,operator*>>` can be used to access the contained value.
* Error state, in which case it contains an object of type `<<error,error>>` or an object of type `<<error_capture,error_capture>>`, and calling `<<result::value,value>>`/`<<result::value,operator*>>` throws `leaf::<<bad_result,bad_result>>`.

To get a `result<T>` object in error state, initialize it with a `leaf::error` or a `leaf::error_capture` .

Otherwise a `result<T>` is initialized in value state using the default constructor of `T`, or by copying or moving from `v`.

IMPORTANT: A `result` that is in value state converts to `true` in boolean contexts. A `result` that is in error state converts to `false` in boolean contexts.

.#include <boost/leaf/result.hpp>
[source,c++]
----
namespace boost { namespace leaf {

} }
----

This member function is designed to be used in `return` statements in functions that return `result<T>` (or `leaf::<<error,error>>`) to return an error to the caller.

Effects: ::
* If `*this` is in value state, returns `leaf::<<error::error,error>>(std::forward<E>(e...))`, which begins propagating a new `error` value (as opposed to forwarding an existing `error` value);
* If `*this` is in error state, it stores either an `<<error_capture,error_capture>>` or a `leaf::<<error,error>>`:
** if `*this` stores an `<<error_capture,error_capture>> cap`, `*this` is converted to store the `leaf::<<error,error>>` value returned from `cap.<<error_capture::unload,unload>>()`, then
** if `*this` stores a `leaf::error` value `err`, returns `err.<<error::propagate,propagate>>(std::forward<E>(e...))`, which forwards the same `error` to the caller, augmenting it with the additional <<e-types,e-type>> objects `e...`.

This header defines some common <<e-types,e-type>> objects which can be used directly:

- The `e_api_function` type is designed to capture the name of the function for which a failure is reported. For example, if you're reporting an error detected by `fread`, you could use `leaf::e_api_function { "fread" }`.
+
WARNING: The passed value is stored as a C string, so you should only pass string literals for `value`.
- When a file operation fails, you could use `e_file_name` to store the name of the file.
- `e_errno` is suitable to capture `errno`. `e_errno` objects use `strerror` to convert the `errno` code to a friendlier error message when `<<diagnostic_output-expect,diagnostic_output>>` is invoked.
- The `LEAF_SOURCE_LOCATION` macro captures `pass:[__FILE__]`, `pass:[__LINE__]` and `pass:[__FUNCTION__]` into a `e_source_location` object.  When `<<diagnostic_output-expect,diagnostic_output>>` is invoked, all three items are printed.

[[techniques]]
== Programming Techniques

[[technique_preload]]
=== Preloading Errors

Consider the following exception type:

====
[source,c++]
----
class file_read_error: public std::exception
{
  std::string file_name_;

  public:

  explicit file_read_error( std::string const & fn ): file_name_(fn) { }

  std::string const & file_name() const noexcept { return file_name_; }
};
----
====

A catch statement that handles `file_read_error` exceptions:

====
[source,c++]
----
catch( file_read_error & e )
{
  std::cerr << "Error reading \"" << e.file_name() << "\"\n";
}
----
====

Finally, a function that may throw `file_read_error` exceptions:

====
[source,c++]
----
void read_file( FILE * f ) {
  ....
  size_t nr=fread(buf,1,count,f);
  if( ferror(f) )
    throw file_read_error(???); //File name not available here!
  ....
}
----
====

This is a problem: the `catch` needs a file name, but at the point of the `throw` a file name is not available (only a `FILE` pointer is). In general, the error might be detected in a library which can not assume that a meaningful name is available for any `FILE` it reads, even if a program that uses the library could reasonably make the same assumption.

Using LEAF, a file name may be associated with any exception after it has been thrown, while anything available at the point of the `throw` (e.g. `errno`) may be passed directly to the `leaf::<<exception::exception,exception>>` constructor:

====
[source,c++]
----
class file_read_error: public std::exception { };
struct e_file_name { std::string value; };
struct e_errno { int value; };

void read_file( FILE * f )
{
  ....
  size_t nr=fread( buf,1,count,f );
  if( ferror(f) )
    throw leaf::exception<file_read_error>( e_errno{errno} );
  ....
}

void process_file( char const * name )
{
  auto propagate = leaf::preload( e_file_name{name} );

  if( FILE * fp=fopen(name,"rt")) {
    std::shared_ptr<FILE> f(fp,fclose);
    ....
    read_file(fp); //throws on error
    ....
  }
  else
    throw leaf::exception<file_open_error>();
}
----

[.text-right]
<<exception>> | <<preload>>
====

The key is the call to `<<preload,preload>>`: it gets the file name ready to be associated with any exception that escapes `process_file`. This is fully automatic, and works regardless of whether the exception is thrown later in the same function, or by `read_file`, or by some third-party function we call.

Now, the `try...catch` that handles exceptions thrown by `process_file` may look like this:

====
[source,c++]
----
leaf::expect<e_errno,e_file_name> exp;
try
{
  process_file("example.txt");
}
catch( file_io_error & e )
{
  std::cerr << "I/O error!\n";

  leaf::handle_exception( exp, e,
    leaf::match<e_file_name,e_errno>( [ ]( std::string const & fn, int errn )
    {
      std::cerr << "File name: " << fn << ", errno=" << errn << "\n";
    } )
  );
}
----

`<<expect,expect>>` | <<handle_exception>> | <<match>>
====

NOTE: This technique works exactly the same way when errors are reported using `leaf::<<result,result>>` rather than by throwing exceptions.

'''

[[technique_defer]]
=== Capturing `errno` with `defer`

Consider the following function:

====
[source,c++]
----
void read_file(FILE * f) {
  ....
  size_t nr=fread(buf,1,count,f);
  if( ferror(f) )
    throw leaf::exception<file_read_error>( e_errno{errno} );
  ....
}
----

[.text-right]
<<exception>>
====

It is pretty straight-forward, reporting `e_errno` as it detects a `ferror`. But what if it calls `fread` multiple times?

====
[source,c++]
----
void read_file(FILE * f) {
  ....
  size_t nr1=fread(buf1,1,count1,f);
  if( ferror(f) )
    throw leaf::exception<file_read_error>( e_errno{errno} );

  size_t nr2=fread(buf2,1,count2,f);
  if( ferror(f) )
    throw leaf::exception<file_read_error>( e_errno{errno} );

  size_t nr3=fread(buf3,1,count3,f);
  if( ferror(f) )
    throw leaf::exception<file_read_error>( e_errno{errno} );
  ....
}
----

[.text-right]
<<exception>>
====

Ideally, associating `e_errno` with each exception should be automated. One way to achieve this is to not call `fread` directly, but wrap it in another function which checks for `ferror` and associates the `e_errno` with the exception it throws.

<<technique_preload,Preloading Errors>> describes how to solve a very similar problem without a wrapper function, but that technique does not work for `e_errno` because `<<preload,preload>>` would capture `errno` before a `fread` call was attempted, at which point `errno` is probably `0` -- or, worse, leftover from a previous I/O failure.

The solution is to use `<<defer,defer>>`, so we don't have to remember to include `e_errno` with each exception; `errno` will be associated automatically with any exception that escapes `read_file`:

====
[source,c++]
----
void read_file(FILE * f) {

  auto propagate = leaf::defer( [ ] { return e_errno{errno} } );

  ....
  size_t nr1=fread(buf1,1,count1,f);
  if( ferror(f) )
    throw leaf::exception<file_read_error>();

  size_t nr2=fread(buf2,1,count2,f);
  if( ferror(f) )
    throw leaf::exception<file_read_error>();

  size_t nr3=fread(buf3,1,count3,f);
  if( ferror(f) )
    throw leaf::exception<file_read_error>();
  ....
}
----

[.text-right]
<<defer>> | <<exception>>
====

This works similarly to `preload`, except that capturing of the `errno` is deferred until the destructor of the `propagate` object is called, which calls the passed lambda function to obtain the `errno`.

'''

[[technique_disparate_error_types]]
=== Working with Disparate Error Codes

Because most libraries define their own mechanism for reporting errors, programmers often need to use multiple incompatible error-reporting interfaces in the same program. This led to the introduction of `boost::error_code` which later became `std::error_code`. Each `std::error_code` object is assigned an `error_category`. Libraries that communicate errors in terms of `std::error_code` define their own `error_category`. For libraries that do not, the user can "easily" define a custom `error_category` and still translate domain-specific error codes to `std::error_code`.

But let`s take a step back and consider _why_ do we have to express every error in terms of the same static type, `std::error_code`? We need this translation because the {CPP} static type-checking system makes it difficult to write functions that may return error objects of the disparate static types used by different libraries. Outside of this limitation, it would be preferable to be able to write functions that can communicate errors in terms of arbitrary {CPP} types, as needed.

To drive this point further, consider the real world problem of mixing `boost::error_code` and `std::error_code` in the same program. In theory, both systems are designed to be able to express one error code in terms of the other. In practice, describing a _generic_ system of error categorization in terms of another _generic_ system of error categorization is not trivial.

Ideally, functions should be able to communicate different error types without having to translate between them, and {CPP} does offer a mechanism that does just that, it's called exception handling. And it is not a coincidence that the attempt to bind {CPP} exception types with the static interface of each function, A.K.A. exception specifications, was so problematic that it had to be abandoned (while I am an outspoken proponent of exception handling, I do acknowledge that in practice, for good reasons or otherwise, exception handling may not be available or permitted).

LEAF solves this problem without using exception handling. For example, to mix `std::error_code` and `boost::error_code` in the same program, we could define:

[source,c++]
----
struct e_std_error_code { std::error_code value; };
struct e_boost_error_code { boost::error_code value; };
----

Then, a scope which is able to handle either `std::error_code` or `boost::error_code` would look like this:

====
[source,c++]
----
{
  leaf::expect<e_std_error_code, e_boost_error_code> exp;

  if( leaf::result<T> r = f() )
  {
    //Success
  }
  else
  {
    bool matched = leaf::handle_error( exp, r,

      leaf::match<e_std_error_code>( [ ]( std::error_code const & e )
      {
        //Handle std::error_code
      } ),

      leaf::match<e_boost_error_code>( [ ]( boost::error_code const & e )
      {
        //Handle boost::error_code
      } )
    );
  }
}
----

[.text-right]
<<expect>> |  <<result>> | <<handle_error-expect>> | <<match>>
====

And here is a function which is able to report either `std::error_code` or `boost::error_code`:

====
[source,c++]
----
leaf::result<T> f()
{
  if( std::error_code ec = g1() )
  {
    //Success
  }
  else
    return leaf::error( e_std_error_code { ec } );

  if( boost::error_code ec = g2() )
  {
    //Success
  }
  else
    return leaf::error( e_boost_error_code { ec } );
}
----

[.text-right]
<<result>> | <<error>>
====

Of course, under refactoring `f` can be changed to return any other error type as needed, without requiring a change in its static interface. With LEAF, such changes become transparent to any error-neutral function that calls and forwards errors from `f` to its caller; only the error handling scope needs to be updated to handle the new error types returned by `f`.

'''

[[technique_augment_in_catch]]
=== Augmenting Exceptions in a `catch`

What makes `<<preload,preload>>` and `<<defer,defer>>` useful (see <<technique_preload,Preloading Errors>> and <<technique_defer,Capturing `errno` with `defer`>>) is that they automatically include <<e-types,e-type>> objects with any exception or error reported by a function.

But what if we need to include some e-object conditionally? When using exception handling, it would be nice to be able to do this in a `catch` statement which selectively augments passing exceptions.

LEAF supports the following approach, assuming all exceptions derive from `std::exception`:

====
[source,c++]
----
try
{
  ....
  function_that_throws();
  ....
}
catch( std::exception const & e )
{
  if( condition )
    leaf::get_error(e).propagate( e_this{....}, e_that{....} );
  throw;
}

The reason we need to use `<<get_error,get_error>>` is that not all exception types derive from `leaf::<<error,error>>`. If the caught exception has a `leaf::error` subobject, `get_error` will return that `leaf::error` value. Also, such exceptions can be intercepted by `catch( error e )` if needed.

But if the caught exception doesn't  have a `leaf::error` subobject, `get_error` returns an unspecified `leaf::error` value, which is temporarily associated with any and all current exceptions, until successfully handled by `<<handle_exception,handle_exception>>`. While this association is imperfect (because it does not pertain to a specific exception object) it is the best that can be done in this case.

[[technique_preload_in_c_callbacks]]
=== Using `peek_next_error` in C-callbacks

Communicating information pertaining to a failure detected in a C callback is tricky, because C callbacks are limited to a specific static signature, which may not use {CPP} types.

LEAF makes this easy. As an example, we'll write a program that uses Lua and reports a failure from a {CPP} function registered as a C callback, called from a Lua program. The failure will be propagated from {CPP}, through the Lua interpreter (written in C), back to the {CPP} function which called it.

C/{CPP} functions designed to be called from a Lua program must use the following signature:

====
[source,c]
----
int do_work( lua_State * L );
----
====

Arguments are passed on the Lua stack (which is accessible through `L`). Results too are pushed onto the Lua stack.

First, let's initialize the Lua interpreter and register `do_work` as a C callback, available for Lua programs to call:

====
[source,c++]
----
std::shared_ptr<lua_State> init_lua_state() noexcept
{
  std::shared_ptr<lua_State> L(lua_open(),&lua_close); //<1>

  lua_register( &*L, "do_work", &do_work ); //<2>

  luaL_dostring( &*L, "\ //<3>
\n      function call_do_work()\
\n          return do_work()\
\n      end" );

  return L;
}
----
<1> Create a new `lua_State`. We'll use `std::shared_ptr` for automatic cleanup.
<2> Register the `do_work` {CPP} function as a C callback, under the global name `do_work`. With this, calls from Lua programs to `do_work` will land in the `do_work` {CPP} function.
<3> Pass some Lua code as a `C` string literal to Lua. This creates a global Lua function called `call_do_work`, which we will later ask Lua to execute.
====

Next, let's define our <<e-types,e-type>> used to communicate `do_work` failures:

====
[source,c++]
----
struct e_do_work_error { int value; };
----
====

We're now ready to define the `do_work` function.

====
[source,c++]
----
int do_work( lua_State * L ) noexcept
{
  bool success=rand()%2; //<1>
  if( success )
  {
    lua_pushnumber(L,42); //<2>
    return 1;
  }
  else
  {
    leaf::peek_next_error().propagate( e_do_work_error{-42} ); //<3>
    return luaL_error(L,"do_work_error"); //<4>
  }
}
----
<1> "Sometimes" `do_work` fails.
<2> In case of success, push the result on the Lua stack, return back to Lua.
<3> Associate an `e_do_work_error` object with the *next* `leaf::error` object we will definitely return from the `call_lua` function (below)...
<4> ...once control reaches it, after we tell the Lua interpreter to abort the program.

[.text-right]
<<peek_next_error>> | `<<error::propagate,error::propagate>>`
====

Now we'll write the function that calls the Lua interpreter to execute the Lua function `call_do_work`, which in turn calls `do_work`. We'll return `<<result,result>><int>`, so that our caller can get the answer in case of success, or an error:

====
[source,c++]
----
leaf::result<int> call_lua( lua_State * L )
{
  lua_getfield( L, LUA_GLOBALSINDEX, "call_do_work" );
  if( int err=lua_pcall(L,0,1,0) ) //<1>
  {
    auto propagate = leaf::preload( e_lua_error_message{lua_tostring(L,1)} ); //<2>
    lua_pop(L,1);
    return leaf::error( e_lua_pcall_error{err} );
  }
  else
  {
    int answer=lua_tonumber(L,-1); //<3>
    lua_pop(L,1);
    return answer;
  }
}
----
<1> Ask the Lua interpreter to call the global Lua function `call_do_work`.
<2> Something went wrong with the call, so we'll return a `leaf::<<error,error>>`. If this is a `do_work` failure, the `e_do_work_error` object prepared in `do_work` will become associated with this `leaf::error` value. If not, we will still need to communicate that the `lua_pcall` failed with an error code and an error message.
<3> Success! Just return the int answer.

[.text-right]
`<<result,result>>` | <<preload>> | `<<error::error,error::error>>`
====

Finally, here is the `main` function which handles all failures:

====
[source,c++]
----
int main() noexcept
{
  std::shared_ptr<lua_State> L=init_lua_state();

  leaf::expect<e_do_work_error,e_lua_pcall_error,e_lua_error_message> exp; //<1>

  for( int i=0; i!=10; ++i )
    if( leaf::result<int> r = call_lua(&*L) )
      std::cout << "do_work succeeded, answer=" << *r << '\n'; //<2>
    else
    {
      bool matched = handle_error( exp, r,

        leaf::match<e_do_work_error>( [ ]( int v ) //<3>
        {
          std::cout << "Got e_do_work_error, value = " << v <<  "!\n";
        } ),

        leaf::match<e_lua_pcall_error,e_lua_error_message>( [ ]( int err, std::string const & msg ) //<4>
        {
          std::cout << "Got e_lua_pcall_error, Lua error code = " << err << ", " << msg << "\n";
        } )
      );
      assert(matched);
    }
  return 0;
}
----
<1> Tell LEAF what <<e-types,e-objects>> are expected.
<2> If the call to `call_lua` succeeded, just print the answer.
<3> Handle `e_do_work` failures.
<4> Handle all other `lua_pcall` failures.

[[technique_transport]]
=== Transporting Errors between Threads

With LEAF, <<e-types,e-objects>> use automatic storage duration, stored inside `<<expect,expect>>` instances. When using concurrency, we need a mechanism to detach e-objects from a worker thread and transport them to another thread where errors are handled.

LEAF offers two interfaces for this purpose, one using `result<T>`, and another designed for programs that use exception handling.

[[technique_transport-result]]
==== Using `result<T>`

Without exceptions, transporting <<e-types,e-objects>> between threads is as easy as calling `<<capture-result,capture>>`, passing the `<<expect,expect>>` object whose contents needs to be transported, and a `<<result,result>><T>` which may be in either value state or error state. This gets us a new `<<result,result>><T>` object which can be safely sent across thread boundaries.

Let's assume we have a `task` which produces a result but could also fail:

====
[source,c++]
----
leaf::result<task_result> task();
----
====

To prepare the returned `result` to be sent across the thread boundary, when we launch the asynchronous task, we wrap it in a lambda function that captures its result:

====
[source,c++]
----
std::future<leaf::result<task_result>> launch_task()
{
  return std::async( std::launch::async, [ ]
    {
      leaf::expect<E1,E2,E3> exp;
      return capture(exp,task());
    } );
}
----

[.text-right]
`<<result,result>>` | `<<expect,expect>>` | <<capture-result>>
====

That's it! Later when we `get` the `std::future`, we can process the returned `result<task_result>` as if it was generated locally:

====
[source,c++]
----
....
leaf::expect<E1,E2,E3> exp;

if( leaf::result<task_result> r = fut.get() )
{
  //Success! Use *r to access task_result.
}
else
{
  handle_error( exp, r,

    leaf::match<E1,E2>( [ ] ( .... )
    {
      //Deal with E1, E2
    } ),

    leaf::match<E3>( [ ] ( .... )
    {
      //Deal with E3
    } )

  );
}

[[technique_transport-exceptions]]
==== Using Exception Handling

When using exception handling, we need to capture the exception using `std::exception_ptr`, then capture the current <<e-types,e-objects>> in an `<<error_capture,error_capture>>` and wrap both into another exception. In the main thread we unwrap and throw the original exception.

This, of course, is done automatically by LEAF. Let's assume we have a `task` which produces a `task_result` and throws on errors:

====
[source,c++]
----
task_result task();
----
====

When we launch the asynchronous task, we wrap it in a simple lambda function which calls `<<capture_exception,capture_exception>>`, specifying which <<e-types,e-objects>> we need transported:

====
[source,c++]
----
std::future<task_result> launch_task()
{
  return std::async( std::launch::async,
    leaf::capture_exception<E1,E2,E3>( [ ]
      {
        return task();
      } ) );
}
----

[.text-right]
<<capture_exception>>
====

Later, instead of using `std::future::get`, we use `leaf::<<get,get>>`, then catch exceptions as if the function was called locally:

====
[source,c++]
----
....
leaf::expect<E1,E2,E3> exp;

try
{
  task_result r = leaf::get(fut);
  //Success!
}
catch( my_exception & e )
{
  handle_exception( exp, e,

    leaf::match<E1,E2>( [ ] ( .... )
    {
      //Deal with E1, E2
    } ),

    leaf::match<E3>( [ ] ( .... )
    {
      //Deal with E3
    } )

  );
}

[[rationale]]
== Design Rationale

Definition: :: Objects that carry information about error conditions are called error objects. For example, objects of type `std::error_code` are error objects.

NOTE: The following reasoning is independent of what mechanics are used to transport error objects, whether it is exception handling or anything else.

Definition: :: Depending on their interaction with error objects, functions can be classified as follows:
* *Error-initiating*: functions that initiate error conditions by creating new error objects.
* *Error-neutral*: functions that forward to the caller error objects returned by functions they call.
* *Error-handling*: functions that dispose of error objects forwarded to them, recovering normal program operation.

A crucial observation is that _error-initiating_ functions are typically low level functions that lack any context and can not determine, much less dictate, the correct program behavior in response to errors they initiate. Error conditions which (correctly) lead to termination in some programs may (correctly) be ignored in others; yet other programs may recover from them and resume normal operation.

Stronger: authors of _error-initiating_ functions may not even reason about what information about the error is required to deal with it, by a specific _error-handling_ function in a specific program domain, except to pass any relevant information which is naturally available to them.

The same reasoning applies to _error-neutral_ functions, but in this case there is the additional problem that the errors they need to communicate, in general, are initiated by functions multiple levels removed from them in the call chain, functions which usually are -- and should be treated as -- implementation details. The _error-neutral_ function should not be coupled with any error object type used by _error-initiating_ functions, for the same reason it should not be coupled with any other aspect of their interface.

Finally, _error-handling_ functions, by definition, have the full context they need to deal with at least some, if not all, failures. In this scope it is an absolute necessity that the author knows exactly what information must be communicated by lower level functions in order to recover from each error condition. Specifically, none of this necessary information can be treated as implementation details; the coupling which is to be avoided by _error-neutral_ functions is unavoidable and even desirable here.

We're now ready to define our

Design goals: ::
* *Error-initiating* functions should be able to communicate all information available to them that is relevant to the failure being reported.
* *Error-neutral* functions should not interfere or be coupled with error-related information that passes through them. They should be able to augment it with any additional information available to them, which may be relevant to any error they forward to the caller.
* *Error-handling* functions should be able to access all the information communicated by _error-initiating_ or _error-neutral_ functions that is needed in their domain in order to deal with failures.

The difficulty in reaching these design goals is in that they seem to require that all error objects be allocated dynamically (the Boost Exception library meets these design goals at the cost of dynamic memory allocation).

As it turns out, dynamic memory allocation is not necessary with the following

Adjustment: ::
* *Error-handling* functions should specify which of the information _error-initiating_ and _error-neutral_ functions are [.underline]#able# to communicate is [.underline]#actually needed# in order to deal with failures in a particular program domain. Ideally, no resources should be [.line-through]#used# wasted storing or communicating information which is not currently needed, even if it is relevant to the failure.

The `leaf::<<expect,expect>><E...>` class template implements this idea: it provides local storage for error objects of the `E...` types. Users instantiate this template in _error-handling_ functions, knowing which types of error objects are needed. When an `expect` object is created, `thread_local` pointers of the `E...` types are set to point to the corresponding storage within it. Later on, _error-initiating_ or _error-neutral_ functions wanting to communicate an error object of type `E` access the corresponding `thread_local` pointer to see if there is currently storage available for this type:

* If the pointer is not null, storage is available and the object is moved into that storage, exactly once -- regardless of how many levels of function calls must unwind before an appropriate _error-handling_ function is reached (that's the function where the `expect` object resides).
* If the pointer is null, storage is not available and the error object is discarded, since there is no use for it -- saving resources.

This almost works, except we need to make sure that _error-handling_ functions are protected from accessing stale error objects stored in `expect` objects, left there from previous failures, which would be a serious logic error. To this end, each failure is assigned a unique serial number, which is transported inside `leaf::<<result,result>>` objects that communicate failures. Each of the `E...` objects stored in an `expect<E...>` object is assigned the same unique identifier, permanently associating it with a particular failure.

Lastly, in _error-handling_ functions it makes sense to be able to not only recognize individual error conditions, but match specific error-handling code with the complete set of error objects that is required in each case.

In terms of {CPP} exception handling, it would be nice to be able to say something like:

====
[source,c++]
----
try
{
  T r = process_file();

  //Success, use r:
  ....
}
catch( file_read_error<e_file_name,e_errno> & e )
{
  std::cerr <<
    "Could not read " << e.get<e_file_name>() <<
    ", errno=" << e.get<e_errno>() << std::endl;
}
catch( file_read_error<e_errno> & e )
{
  std::cerr <<
    "File read error, errno=" << e.get<e_errno>() << std::endl;
}
catch( file_read_error<> & e )
{
  std::cerr << "File read error!" << std::endl;
}
----
====

That is to say, it is desirable to be able to dispatch error handling based not only on the kind of failure being handled, but also based on the kind of error objects available. Unfortunately this syntax is not possible and, even if it were, not all programs use exceptions to handle errors.

Below is the same snippet, expressed in terms of LEAF:

====
[source,c++]
----
leaf::expect<e_file_name, e_errno> exp;

try
{
  T r = process_file(); //Throws in case of failure, error objects stored inside exp.

  //Success, use r:
  ....
}
catch( file_read_error & e )
{
  //Match available error objects stored in exp,
  //associated with the specific failure communicated by e.
  leaf::handle_exception( exp, e,

    leaf::match<e_file_name, e_errno>( [ ]( std::string const & file_name, int errno_ )
    {
      std::cerr <<
        "Could not read " << file_name <<
        ", errno=" << errno_ << std::endl;
    } ),

    leaf::match<e_errno>( [ ]( int errno_ )
    {
      std::cerr <<
        "File read error, errno=" << errno_ << std::endl;
    } ),

    leaf::match<>( [ ]
    {
      std::cerr << "File read error!" << std::endl;
    } )

  );
}
----

[.text-right]
`<<expect,expect>>` | <<handle_exception>> | <<match>>
====

Of course LEAF works without exception handling as well. Below is the same snippet, written using `<<result,result>><T>`:

====
[source,c++]
----
leaf::expect<e_what, e_file_name, e_errno> exp;

if( leaf::result<T> r = process_file() ) //In case of failure error objects are stored inside exp.
{
  //Success, use r.value():
  ....
}
else
{
  //e_what is used to dispatch between error conditions:
  switch( *leaf::peek<e_what>(exp,r) )
  {
    case file_read_error:
    {
      //Match available error objects stored in exp,
      //associated with the specific failure communicated by r.
      bool handled = leaf::handle_error( exp, r,

        leaf::match<e_file_name, e_errno>( [ ]( std::string const & file_name, int errno_ )
        {
          std::cerr <<
            "Could not read " << file_name <<
            ", errno=" << errno_ << std::endl;
        } ),

        leaf::match<e_errno>( [ ]( int errno_ )
        {
          std::cerr <<
          "File read error, errno=" << errno_ << std::endl;
        } ),

        leaf::match<>( [ ]
        {
          std::cerr << "File read error!" << std::endl;
        } )

      );
      if( handled )
        break;
    }
    //fallthrough:
    default:
      return r; //Error not handled, forward to the caller.

[critique]
=== Critique

[[exception_specifications]]
[discrete]
==== LEAF Does Not Enforce Correct Error Handling at Compile Time

A common critique of the LEAF design is that it does not statically enforce correct error handling. One specific idea I've heard from multiple sources is to add `E...` parameter pack to `result<T>`.

The idea is to be able to write something along these lines:

====
[source,c++]
----
result<T, E1, E2, E3> f() noexcept; <1>

result<T, E1, E3> g() noexcept <2>
{
  if( result<T, E1, E2, E3> r = f() )
  {
    return r; //Success, return the T
  }
  else
  {
    return r.handle_error<E2>( [ ] ( .... ) <3>
      {
        ....
      } );
  }
}
----
<1> `f` may only return errors of type `E1`, `E2`, `E3`.
<2> `g` narrows that to only `E1` and `E3`.
<3> Because `g` may only return errors of type `E1` and `E3`, it uses `handle_error` to deal with `E2`. In case `r` contains `E1` or `E3`, `handle_error` simply returns `r`, narrowing the error type parameter pack from `E1, E2, E3` down to `E1, E3`. If `r` contains an `E2`, `handle_error` calls the supplied lambda, which is required to return one of `E1`, `E3` (or a valid `T`).
====

The motivation here is to help avoid bugs in functions that handle errors that pop out of `g`: as long as the programmer deals with `E1` and `E3`, he can rest assured that no error is left unhandled.

Congratulations, we've just discovered exception specifications. The difference is that exception specifications, before being removed from {CPP}, were enforced dynamically, while this idea is equivalent to statically-enforced exception specifications, like they are in Java.

Why not statically enforce exception specifications?

"The short answer is that nobody knows how to fix exception specifications in any language, because the dynamic enforcement C++ chose has only different (not greater or fewer) problems than the static enforcement Java chose. ... When you go down the Java path, people love exception specifications until they find themselves all too often encouraged, or even forced, to add `throws Exception`, which immediately renders the exception specification entirely meaningless. (Example: Imagine writing a Java generic that manipulates an arbitrary type `T`)."
-- Herb Sutterfootnote:[https://herbsutter.com/2007/01/24/questions-about-exception-specifications/]

Stated differently, the problem is that attempts to harness the {CPP} static type checking system to help enforce correct error handling based on the types of errors a function may return leads to dynamic error types. Yes, it is possible to turn every error *type* into, for example, a `std::error_code` *object*, but this immediately renders the use of static type checking to enforce correct error handling meaningless. Worse, the coupling of function signatures with the error types they may return interferes with the correct propagation of errors throughout the program.

Error handling, by its very nature, is a dynamic process. An effective error handling strategy is to:

* Facilitate efficient propagation of error objects of arbitrary types throughout the program, independent of funciton signatures (LEAF).
* Write unit tests for each and every error condition. To this end, unfortunately, static type checking can only provide limited assistance.
